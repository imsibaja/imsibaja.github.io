## Hello World

In my first language:
``` {C++}
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  std::cout<<"Hello, World!"<<std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In my favorite language:
```{python}
print("Hello, World!")
```

In a language I am forced to use: 
```{r}
print("Hello, World!")
```
Erm... How original...

No programmer is complete without the proverbial "Hello World!". Now that that is done, I'll the rest of the blog will be dedicated to Environmental Data Science. What is that you say? Why don't you check out my other posts and find out!
